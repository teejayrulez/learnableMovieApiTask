# Movie Api
I developed a simple movie api where you can rent movies

### How the code 
1. Open your terminal.
2. Input 'node app.js' and the code will begin.
3. Once you open the store you will see our products.
4. Just pick a movie to rent.

### Features
1. Readable - A neat and tidy code without bugs.
2. Simplicty - This is a very easy code to use.
3. Readline - Used for synchronous user input .
4. Abstraction - One of the four principles of UML(Unified Modeling Language). This abstraction allows the program to work with movies without needing to know the intricate details of their implementation.
